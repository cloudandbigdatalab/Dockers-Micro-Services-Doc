Pre-Requisites

1.	Tutum Account

2.	Chameleon Cloud does not have a Lease/Link/Tie-up with Tutum. So we should bring our container node into tutum, by going into nodes menu,and then following these steps:
	1.	Go to node dashboard
	2.	Click bring your own node
	3.	Copy the code in the popup page
	4.	SSH in to your instance using your Private key
	5.	Run the copied code from step 3 into the Instances Terminal and press enter
	6.	Tutum is now installed in your KVM Instance
	
3.	Now we need to create the Repository. 
	If you want to link your github account to TUTUM, go to your account info and select </> Source Providers and add your GitHub account into it. 
	
	Once you are ready to create a repository, do the following steps:
	1.	Choose Create new repository
	2.	Give a repository name and an optional description and press Create
	3.	Press Edit to change the Repository parameters. 
	

	

	
	
	Shawns TUTORIAL in Tutum
	
	
	The problem:
	
		No Dockerfile in root directory.
	The fix:
		You should make 3 seperate repositories in your TUTUM account and name them nginx, postgres, uwsgi respectively.
		
		Now, follow the steps:
		1.	Log in to tutum CLI, our container in KVM
		2.	git clone https://github.com/arundasan91/tutorial-cham-docker-1.git
		3.	sudo cp -a /home/cc/tutorial-cham-docker-1/. /home/cc/
		4.	sudo docker build nginx
		5.	sudo docker tag <imagenameofnginx> tutum.co/arundas/nginx:nginx
		6.	sudo docker build postgres 
		7.	sudo docker tag <imagenameofpostgres> tutum.co/arundas/postgres:postgres
		8.	sudo docker build uwsgi
		9.	sudo docker tag <imagenameofuwsgi> tutum.co/arundas/uwsgi:uwsgi
		10.	sudo docker push tutum.co/arundas/nginx:nginx
		11.	sudo docker push tutum.co/arundas/postgres:postgres
		12.	sudo docker push tutum.co/arundas/uwsgi:uwsgi
		13.	Log in to your tutum account in tutum.co and go into your repositories pages.
		
				ISSUES
		14. Your Services should be linked with one another. For this follow these steps:
			1.	In your Service dashboard, select the container which needs to be linked.
			2.	Press Edit ( Green Button )
			3.	Check the configuration and press Next: environment variables button ( Blue Button ) in the lower left corner.
			4.	Select Link Services and choose the service which you want to link and press Add
			5.	Specify other parameters as required.
			6.	Press Save.
		
				ISSUES
		Services will choose the nodes according to the policy that you select while creating them. Should look in to ways in which we can deploy a service in a particular node.
			
				FIX
		Use Deploy Tags. Say tag named ' host1 ' and ' host2 ' to specify which node to choose/consider while starting the service.
			
				PROBLEM
		A tag should be written into the service, there is no option to choose between tags while starting a service. It is predetermined and should be saved by the user.
		
		
		
		
		
		
		14. Start the postgres image, followed by uwsgi and then the nginx image
